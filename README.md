This is a small example of the workflow built with Apache Airflow.

You can find slides [here](https://www.slideshare.net/varyakarpenko5/airflow-for-beginners) and watch the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtfU0MQZ_4)

The goal is to set up a data pipline to get a fresh portion of Stack Overflow questions with tag `pandas` to our mailbox daily.

A small python script could do the job, but for the learning purposes we choose to overengineer it.

By writing this workflow we will learn the main concepts of Apache Airflow, such as:
    
* Operators
* DAG
* Tasks
* Hooks
* Variables
* Connections
* XComs

Happy learning 🤓
